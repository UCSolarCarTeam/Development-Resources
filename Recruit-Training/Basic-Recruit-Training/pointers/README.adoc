= Pointers

One of the most important concepts in C/C++ programming is pointers.
We will look at an example chunk of code that uses pointers to change the value in a variable before exploring pointers more in depth.

----
int x;
x = 0;
int *p;
p = &x;
*p = 6;

cout << x << endl; //this prints the number 6
----
cd
First lets look at a pointer variable:

----
int * p;
----

A pointer is very similar to other primitive data types such as int.
Instead of containing values, pointers contain memory addresses to the location of another variable.
To initialize a pointer use an asterisk after the type that the pointer will be pointing to.
This will create a variable p, which is a pointer that will be able to point to a variable of type int.
In order to assign our pointer p to the address of a variable we will need to use the address operator, &.

----
int x;
int *p;

x = 3;
p = &x;

cout << p << endl; //this prints an address such as 0x7ffc0b657c7c
----

Now the memory address of x will be stored in p.
This means that the value for x is stored on your machine at the memory location 0x7ffc9b657c7c.
Next lets look at the dereferencing operator:

----
int x;
int *p;
int y;

x = 3;
p = &x;

y = *p;

cout << y << endl; //this will print the value 3
----

We use the dereferencing operator to get the value stored at the address pointed to by the pointer.
One of the most common uses of pointers is when passing them as an argument to a function.
We will explore why this is so useful in the coding exercise later.
Let's look at an example:

----
//function prototype
void foo(int &a);

int main()
{
    int x = 1;
    int* p = &x;
    foo(*p);
}

void foo(int &a)
{
    //some code
}
----

By passing the pointer p into the function instead of x we can change the value that the pointer is pointing to.

Pointers are also very useful when working with data structures such as arrays.
In the case of an array a pointer will point to the first byte of the array.
If the array is of type int, which is 4 bytes, then the address of each array index will be 4 bytes greater then the previous one.

Now move on to the pointer exercise in main.cpp and follow the directions in there
